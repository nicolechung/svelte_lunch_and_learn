## React and Svelte 3

Embedding Svelte components into React. This is based on [react-svelte](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/react-svelte) with a few changes:

1. Svelte 3 instead of Svelte 2
2. Babel loader instead of the [buble-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/buble-loader). This is because moar React projects use Babel.
